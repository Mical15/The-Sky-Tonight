# The Sky Tonight

## Summary
React app that notifies users what astronomy objects are in the sky at the College of San Mateo on the night they access the app.

## Motovation
The College of San Mateo, located in San Mateo California, hosting numerious FREE astronomy public events. One of the most popular is "Jazz Under The Stars". At this event the astronomy faculity and staff open up the observatory, play the schools jazz radio station, and show the public any fun astronomy objects that are currently in the sky. One problem with the program is that staff often get inundated with emails from the public asking what objects they could see on that paticular night. With this in mind, I've decided to make a small react app that calls upon (In version 1) [csymlstd's API](https://github.com/csymlstd/visible-planets-api) and returns what objects will be visable from CSM's observatory. Eventually I hope to do these calculations myself, as there are numerious factors that [csymlstd's API](https://github.com/csymlstd/visible-planets-api) does not take into consideration. Such as: weather, elevation, light pollution. I would also eventually like to add additional popular objects, such as the ISS, or any major comets.
